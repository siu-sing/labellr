"Tess Lindsay is content to be the sole occupant of a remote island but when Colin Macpherson washes ashore her life of solitude gets shaken up. Tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with Colin. Soon Tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new life?The beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem. The plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization. All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason. Even Tess and Colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced. The writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book. Unless you have your heart set on reading all of the books in the series",4

THIS IS SIMPLY A GREAT ALBUM,
This is my first encounter with Yoruba and I have to say that CDs are really helping. However,
works real good....a little hard to set up...web part doesnt work thru handset manager as advertised.....have to go into networking and turn it on,
It is a quality ball but the small is still too big and heavy for my little yorkie to play with comfortably.,
I have to admit that this is a book I never would have thought to purchase given that it would mean reading the bio of an 18 year old kid!!! Still,
"Y TAMBIEN LA VIDA INTIMA DE LOS TRIUNFADORES...Por eso me fascinó este libro que me regaló mi esposa !Y seguro a mis cuantes tambien..porque alguno de ellos me ""incautó "" el libro !YA DEVUELVELO",
"Man I love Oh's cereal. It is really great to the last bite",
In a world where media is dominant this movie is so refreshing as it chronicles the agony of a person who yearns for God. Watch it! 0:),
"This book is quite touching. It tells Dorie's story of all the unbelievably horribe things she experience while growing up being abused both physially and sexually. It gives hope to those who believe that no one's situation is as bad as their's or those who think recovery is not possible. If you are looking for self help to enhance you own healing journey this book is probably not what you need if you dont fall into the above categories. However",
This book never really seems to get going. There is too much time spent in the courtroom while basic questions about the crime and the suspect/defendant are left unasked.After 200 pages,
While I believe in discrimination,

"I've been using this model racket for around 15 years and it's still one of the best rackets ever made by Prince. The Prince Graphite Mid Plus is still one of the stiffest rackets you can get and it also has excellence weight and balance.This racket is more suited to the higher standard player. It provides exceptional control especially with volleys. I have these rackets strung at between 62-64 pounds for hard court and grass court play.It will be a sad day when there are no more of these rackets available.",
"I didn't buy this game",
Like many of the Barbie CD Roms,
"This game interesting. It has good graphics and nice music. But if youre my age lets re-think the fun part. All you do is press up and down on the keybord and maybe you would hit the space bar. Well if your child likes challenging games well don't get this for them. THIS IS FOR A PRESCHOOLER!!!!",
I bought this game for my daughter who is almost seven. She enjoys it very much. It works perfectly with Windows XP. I like the fact that it has skill levels,
Very disappointed in this product. It worked perfectly for exactly three days and could not be resuscitated. It was very inexpensive so I did not want to pay half again the price to ship it back for an exchange,
These work fine and we now have two in the apartment,
I was sceptical about this book at first,
I loved reading this book,
I agree w/ the other fans: Chocolate is a fantastic single. If you like the song,
I bought the DVD thinking it would be back to back episodes of Thomas with no interruptions. Instead it has footage of a Thomas event and children and adults giving reviews of Thomas and their favorite episodes. I found it cheesy and annoying. My son loves Thomas and I hoped it would be strictly the episodes and not other footage. Thankfully the footage between the episodes is brief enough to tolerate the video.,
Our two-year old grandson loved this - and we enjoyed watching it with him. Some good lessons to be learned by any age!,
What can I say it is a surge protector and small enough to use with small electronic items such as a wireless phone system,
"My son really liked this as it shows some scenes from Thomas' Day Out which he could relate to having been before.The footage is mixed in with Thomas episodes and interviews. The brief interview sections did'nt really hold his attention but the rest is really good.",
"I have bought dockers for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are. Even with the ""stretch"" waist band they are tight. So much for an ""extra"" inch. Beware. Try these in a store before you buy.",
I agree,
I ordered the individual fit Dockers pants. Although there was a tag on the pants that said they were individual fit,
This novel is just fun...not super serious literature but enjoyable.I would recommend this to anyone who loves Italy and food...You can read it in a day....,
This is a very fun book and if you love Rome,
I bought this book to read as I myself ventured the streets of Italy...and to my dismay,
A clichéd storyline based on the classic Cyrano de Bergerac,
"This book as all about the joy of eating and cooking and love.It's a lot better when it deals with food than with love. In fact",
it really pains me to see bone thugs loose to the hot boyz for group of the year at the source awards.everybody was pi$$ed over that robbery.i have a lot of respect for southern rap music.but bone had a far superior album then this album.after that i lost all hope in the source awards.this album have a somewhat solid production value from mannie,
"I feel ya ""Ghenry187@aol.com""...this CD rocks. No Limit can't touch Cash $ Money Records. I don't know why that new Tru CD sold one million in the first place. Who cares",
"Although better than there latest album I didn't care much for Guerilla Warfare. I found alot of the songs on the album to all sound almost exactly the same. It did have some outstanding hot tracks like I need a Hot Girl",
"Before i say anything about this album Cash Money Records is the Sh*t. I just didn't think this album was very good. The beats and hooks were not what i was expecting. I need a Hot Girl was the best song.",
This is a book that I read at home,
"and I have been quite satisfied.Although I don't think a ""Complete"" reference book on programming",
Being a great fan of ff6,
I have been using this product for years because I have a chronic cough. I think it helps keep my throat moist and helps prevent and alleviate sore throat.,

"the reason i gave two stars when I usually give 5 stars for ms. feehan's books is b/c this book was tooooooo mystery/gothic genre rather than romance. I really didn't feel like the two main characters were in love",
This is a very good background book for the Dark Series by Christine Feehan. Very romantic,
"love it...very touch.it's to bad that in the dvd description doesn't mention no subtitles",
This is another of Christine Feehan brilliant books. She can make you part of that,
This is truly an excellent camcorder for home movies and perhaps more advanced applications. I found myself toying around with the nightvision contantly. My only qualms about it was that recording videos to your PC is really dependent on how good a computer you have. For instance,
"Cornwell takes hold of your mind and does to let go until Scarpetta finds her solution. There is a horrible crime scene but it does produce some fingerprints. This is an easy case for Scarpetta until there is a match. It was a match to murderer that was executed before this murder. Read the book it is a good one. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream""",
This book was a bit more difficult to follow,
I must say I was required to read this book for a class. If that had not been the case,
"I just wrote a review on this book and I forgot to include something. WHAT HAPPEND TO MARK. Out of the blue he's all of a sudden dead!",
One of the best but all Scarpetta are terrific. Love how she continues the characters and creates wonderful story lines in each book. Scarpetta is a must read for crime mystery fans!,
"... and perhaps that's what made it unpalatable to many of his fans. Characters are extremely well-developed (AND portrayed)",
Although this might be a good book to introduce issues in technical writing to someone considering the field,
